<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vaccine Contract Manufacturing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fill-Finish</li><li>Bulk Product</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vaccine contract manufacturing market consists of two primary types: fill-finish and bulk product markets. The fill-finish segment involves the final stages of vaccine production, where the product is filled into vials or syringes, sealed, and labeled for distribution. This process ensures the vaccine's stability and sterility. The bulk product market, on the other hand, focuses on the large-scale production of vaccine components before they undergo fill-finish operations. Both segments are crucial for ensuring efficient vaccine delivery.</p></p>
